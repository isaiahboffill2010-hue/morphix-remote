# Phase 5 — QD330 printer control

**Status:** built and tested against a fake printer only. **Not validated on the real QD330.**
Control stays **disabled** until every step of the [operator checklist](#operator-validation-checklist) has passed with the user present.

Everything lives in `packages/printer/src` and is exported from `@morphix/printer`:

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `index.ts` | Phase 1 observer (`TcpTransport`, `PrinterObserver`, …), unchanged behaviour; re-exports everything below |
| `protocol.ts` | Wire format: command framing, reply parsing, raw-byte upload chunks, CRC-32, M661 list parser. Pure functions |
| `names.ts` | `sanitizeFileName` (uploads), `assertStoredFileName` (files already on the printer) |
| `auth.ts` | `authorizePrint`, `PrintAuthorizer`, `PrintAuthorization` tokens |
| `control.ts` | `QD330Controller`: job control (listFiles, uploadFile, startPrint, pause, resume, cancel) and machine control (readInfo, home, setLight, setFan, setNozzleTemp, setBedTemp, coolDown, motorsOff, emergencyStop, capabilities) |
| `machine.ts` | Machine-control helpers: command builders, hard limits, `allowUnverified` flags, the command table behind `capabilities()` |
| `tracker.ts` | `JobTracker` (progress, completion/failure events), `detectActivePrint` (restart recovery) |
| `fake-server.ts` | `FakeQD330`, a fake printer on 127.0.0.1 for tests and demos |

Tests: `tests/phase5-*.test.ts` and `tests/printer-control-*.test.ts`. They only ever connect to 127.0.0.1; `tests/phase5-helpers.ts` patches `Socket.connect` so any other host fails the test.

---

## Safety model

1. **Disabled by default.** `new QD330Controller({ enabled, host })` requires an explicit boolean. With `enabled: false`, every control method (`listFiles`, `uploadFile`, `startPrint`, `pause`, `resume`, `cancel`) throws `ControllerDisabledError` before opening a socket, and a `rejected` log entry is written. There is no setter: turning control on means constructing a new controller.
2. **Separate from observation.** The Phase 1 observer and its read-only allowlist are unchanged. `controller.transport` is a read-only transport (same allowlist) that shares the controller's queue, so status polls and control sessions never overlap. It works while control is disabled.
3. **Approval tokens.** Anything that starts or changes a print needs a `PrintAuthorization` from `authorizePrint({ jobId, fileName, approvedBy: "touch" | "voice", expiresInMs })`:
   - only tokens issued by this process are accepted (looked up by a random id; a copied or edited token is `unknown`/`tampered`);
   - bound to one `jobId` **and** one `fileName`; mismatches are rejected;
   - short-lived: default 2 min, hard cap 10 min;
   - `startPrint` and `resume` **consume** the token (single use). The token is consumed right before the command is sent, so a busy printer or a missing file does not burn the approval;
   - `uploadFile` checks the token but does not consume it, so one approval covers "upload this file, then start it".
   - Rejections throw `PrintAuthorizationError` with `code`: `missing | unknown | tampered | expired | reused | job-mismatch | file-mismatch`. Nothing is sent.
4. **Pause and cancel need no token** (stopping must always be possible) but take `{ requestedBy: "touch" | "voice" | "guardian" | "system", reason? }` and are always logged.
5. **Confirmed, not assumed.** Every result is `{ sent, acknowledged, confirmed, status, error }`. Only `confirmed` means done, and it is set only when the printer's own status (M119/M27, polled until a timeout) shows the expected change. A `Received … ok` reply without the status change is reported as `acknowledged: true, confirmed: false` with an error.
6. **Preconditions before sending.** Upload only when `READY` and (unless `overwrite`) the name is not already stored. Start only when `READY` and the file is in the M661 list. Pause only when `BUILDING_FROM_SD`. Resume only from a paused status, and only for the paused file. Cancel is always sent.
7. **File names.** Uploads are sanitised to `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, ≤ 64 chars, `.gx` only (`.g` only with `allowPlainGcode: true`; plain `.g` was only ever tried with the old framed upload, which corrupted the file). Files already on the printer (e.g. official Afinia files with spaces) are passed through `assertStoredFileName`, which rejects `/ \ ~`, control characters and leading dots, so nothing can inject a second command.
8. **No direct G-code.** The controller has no method that sends arbitrary commands; commands are built only from the verbs listed below.
9. **One thing at a time.** All control and status traffic goes through one queue; every session is `M601 S1 … M602`.
10. **Machine controls** ([below](#machine-controls)) are behind the same `enabled` switch. Commands not verified on this printer also need their own `allowUnverified` flag, set by the operator one at a time after the [machine checklist](#machine-controls-validation-checklist). Heating needs an explicit `approvedBy` and arms an idle safety timer. Repeated taps are debounced. Cancel, cool-down and emergency stop are never debounced.

## API

### `QD330Controller`

```ts
const controller = new QD330Controller({
  enabled: false,              // required, explicit
  host: "192.168.10.51",
  port: 8899,
  // optional (defaults):
  connectTimeoutMs: 4000,
  replyTimeoutMs: 5000,
  startReplyTimeoutMs: 10_000, // M23 reply
  uploadFinishTimeoutMs: 15_000, // M29 reply
  startConfirmTimeoutMs: 20_000, // wait for BUILDING_FROM_SD after M23
  confirmTimeoutMs: 10_000,    // wait for the expected status after M25/M24/M26
  pollIntervalMs: 1000,
  packetDelayMs: 0,            // between 4 KB upload chunks
  uploadFlushDelayMs: 3000,    // pause before M29
  maxUploadBytes: 64 MiB,
  allowPlainGcode: false,
  pausedStatuses: ["PAUSED"],  // UNVERIFIED — set from checklist step 6
  authorizer: defaultPrintAuthorizer,
  log: (entry: ControlLogEntry) => void,
});
```

| Method | Command(s) | Token | Confirmed when | Hardware-verified |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `readStatus()` | M119 M105 M114 M27 | — | (read-only, allowed while disabled) | yes |
| `listFiles()` | M661 | — | binary list parsed | yes |
| `uploadFile(name, data, { jobId, authorization, onProgress?, overwrite? })` | M28, raw bytes, 3 s pause, M29 | checked, not consumed | file appears in M661 | single packet only |
| `startPrint({ jobId, fileName, authorization })` | M23 `0:/user/<name>` | consumed | `MachineStatus: BUILDING_FROM_SD` and `CurrentFile` matches | yes (status change); a real `.gx` print: **no** |
| `pause({ requestedBy, reason? })` | M25 | none, logged | `MachineStatus` ∈ `pausedStatuses` | **no** |
| `resume({ jobId, fileName, authorization })` | M24 | consumed | `MachineStatus: BUILDING_FROM_SD` | **no** |
| `cancel({ requestedBy, reason? })` | M26 | none, logged | `MachineStatus: READY` | yes |

`ControlResult<T>`:

```ts
{
  op: "listFiles" | "upload" | "start" | "pause" | "resume" | "cancel";
  sent: boolean;          // the control command reached the socket
  acknowledged: boolean;  // "CMD <X> Received." … "ok", no error text
  confirmed: boolean;     // printer status shows the change — the only "done"
  protocolVerified: boolean; // false for M24/M25
  status?: PrinterStatus; // last status read during the operation
  reply?: string; error?: string; data?: T;
}
```

Throws (nothing sent): `ControllerDisabledError`, `PrintAuthorizationError`, `InvalidFileNameError`, `RangeError` (empty/oversized upload). Every other problem (timeout, dropped connection, printer refusing control, wrong status) comes back as a result with `error` set and `confirmed: false`.

`UploadProgress` passed to `onProgress` after each 4 KB chunk: `{ bytesSent, totalBytes, packetsSent, totalPackets, percent }`.

`ControlLogEntry`: `{ at, op, outcome: "rejected" | "failed" | "unconfirmed" | "confirmed", jobId?, fileName?, approvedBy?, requestedBy?, reason?, sent, acknowledged, confirmed, error?, status? }`.

### Approval

```ts
const token = authorizePrint({ jobId, fileName: "Robot_Arm.gx", approvedBy: "touch", expiresInMs: 60_000 });
```

`PrintAuthorizer` (class) exists for tests and custom clocks; `defaultPrintAuthorizer` is the process-wide instance used by `authorizePrint` and by every controller unless one is passed in. `revoke(token)` cancels an approval.

### Job tracking

```ts
const tracker = new JobTracker({ pausedStatuses, completeAtProgress: 99 });
tracker.on("progress", (job) => …);  // also: started, recovered, paused, resumed,
                                      // completed, cancelled, failed, offline, online,
                                      // unknownStatus(job, machineStatus), change
tracker.update(status);               // feed every PrinterObserver status
tracker.track({ jobId, fileName, status }); // after startPrint() is confirmed
tracker.noteCancelRequested();        // before/when cancel() is sent
tracker.attachJob(jobId);             // link a recovered print to a DB job
tracker.job;                          // { jobId, fileName, phase, progress, layer, recovered, offline, … }
detectActivePrint(status, pausedStatuses) // { fileName, paused, progress, layer } | null
```

Rules: `BUILDING_FROM_SD` or a paused status with no tracked job → `recovered` (app restart, or a print started at the printer). Return to `READY` → `cancelled` if a cancel was noted, else `completed` if progress ≥ `completeAtProgress` or the last layer was reached (looking at both the last building status and the READY status), else `failed`. Any other MachineStatus → `unknownStatus`, no outcome guessed. Offline polls keep the job (the SD print carries on) and emit `offline`/`online`. Completion detection is a heuristic until checklist step 4 confirms what M27 shows at the end of a real print.

### Fake printer

```ts
const fake = new FakeQD330({ files: { "cube.gx": buf }, pausedStatus: "PAUSED", stateChangeDelayMs: 0, m661Ok: true,
  failures: { refuseControl, silent: ["M23"], dropOn: ["M26"], corruptPacket: 1, dropOnPacket: 2, rejectUpload,
              loseUploadedFile, ignoreStart, ignorePause, ignoreResume, ignoreCancel } });
const port = await fake.listen();   // always 127.0.0.1
fake.setProgress(45, [45, 100]); fake.finishPrint(); fake.abortPrint();
fake.received;      // every command, in order
fake.uploads;       // upload outcomes
fake.controlConflicts; // M601 attempts refused because another connection held control
await fake.close();
```

Reply formats copied from the real printer: `CMD X Received.` … `ok`, `Control Success V2.1.`, `Control Release.`, M115/M119/M105/M114/M27 bodies, the binary M661 list, `Writing to file: /data/<name>`, `File opened: <name> Size: <n>` / `File selected`. Error wordings (M28/M29/M23 failures, per-packet CRC errors, `Control failed.`) and the paused status string are guesses and are marked `UNVERIFIED` in the source.

---

## Machine controls

Same controller, same `ControlResult` shape, same log. `protocolVerified` is `true` only for commands checked on the real QD330.

```ts
const controller = new QD330Controller({
  enabled: settings.printControlsEnabled === true,
  host: "192.168.10.51",
  allowUnverified: {           // all default false; set one by one after the checklist below
    light: false,              // setLight (M146)
    fan: false,                // setFan (M106/M107)
    temperatures: false,       // setNozzleTemp, setBedTemp, coolDown (M104/M140)
    motors: false,             // motorsOff (M18)
    emergencyStopM112: false,  // emergencyStop also sends M112 first
  },
  heaterIdleTimeoutMs: 15 * 60_000, // heaters off after this long without a heating command, unless printing
  heaterRetryMs: 30_000,            // retry interval if that cool-down could not be sent
  minCommandIntervalMs: 1000,       // debounce for repeated machine commands
  cancelCoolDownWindowMs: 120_000,  // after a cancel, cooling is allowed even if the status still shows the print
  homeConfirmTimeoutMs: 60_000,     // G28 reply + confirmation
  homePosition: { x: 110, y: 110, z: 220 }, // verified
  maxNozzleC: 250, maxBedC: 100,    // may be lowered, never raised (constructor throws)
});
```

| Method | Command(s) | Flag | State rule | Confirmed when | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `readInfo({ requestedBy? })` | M115 | — (read-only, works while disabled) | any | machine type/firmware parsed | yes |
| `home({ requestedBy, reason? })` | G28 | — | READY and not MOVING | M114 at `homePosition` (±0.5 mm) and MoveMode ≠ MOVING | yes |
| `setLight(true \| false \| {r,g,b}, { requestedBy })` | `M146 r<r> g<g> b<b> F0` | `light` | any (also while printing) | M119 `LED:` matches on/off (the colour cannot be read back) | **no** |
| `setFan(true \| false \| 0-100, { requestedBy })` | `M106 S<0-255>` / `M107` | `fan` | any | never: no fan read-back. `acknowledged` + `note` | **no** |
| `setNozzleTemp(c, { requestedBy, approvedBy? })` | `M104 S<c> T0` | `temperatures` | heating: READY; 0 °C: not printing (or cancel window) | M105 `T0` target = c (±0.5) | **no** |
| `setBedTemp(c, { requestedBy, approvedBy? })` | `M140 S<c>` | `temperatures` | as above | M105 `B` target = c | **no** |
| `coolDown({ requestedBy })` | `M104 S0 T0`, `M140 S0` | `temperatures` | not printing (or cancel window) | both targets 0 | **no** |
| `motorsOff({ requestedBy })` | M18 | `motors` | READY and not MOVING | never: no read-back. `acknowledged` + `note` | **no** |
| `emergencyStop({ requestedBy })` | [M112], M26, `M104 S0 T0`, `M140 S0` | M112 only with `emergencyStopM112` | any | READY and both targets 0 | M26 yes; M104/M140/M112 no → `protocolVerified: false` |
| `capabilities(status?)` | — | — | — | — | — |
| `heaterSafety()` | — | — | — | `{ armed, expiresAt, remainingMs, targets }` | — |
| `dispose()` | — | — | — | stops the heater timer (call on shutdown) | — |

`requestedBy` is required on every machine command: `"touch" | "voice" | "portal" | "guardian" | "system"`. It is written to every log entry together with `command` (the exact G-code, e.g. `M104 S200 T0`).

**Throws (nothing sent, `rejected` log entry):**
- `ControllerDisabledError`: controller disabled.
- `CommandDisabledError` (a subclass of `ControllerDisabledError`, with `.command` and `.flag`): the command's `allowUnverified` flag is off. The message names the flag to set.
- `ControlLimitError` (a `RangeError`): temperature outside 0–250 °C nozzle / 0–100 °C bed (or the lowered limits), fan outside 0–100 %, colour channel not an integer 0–255.
- `HeaterApprovalError`: heating (target > 0) without `approvedBy: "touch" | "voice" | "portal"`. Setting 0 °C needs no approval.
- `RateLimitedError` (with `.retryAfterMs`): the same command was accepted less than `minCommandIntervalMs` ago, or a *different* request for it is still running. An *identical* request while one is running gets the same result object (duplicate taps send once).
- `TypeError`: missing or unknown `requestedBy`.

State problems (printing, moving, unreachable) come back as a result with `sent: false` and `error`, like `pause`/`startPrint`.

### Rules

- **Temperatures during a print:** refused (heating and cooling). Exception: within `cancelCoolDownWindowMs` after `cancel()`/`emergencyStop()` sent M26, cooling is allowed even if the printer still reports the print. Heating is never allowed then.
- **Heater idle timer:** every heating command (re)arms it, *before* the command is sent (if the reply is lost the heater may still be on). When it fires: if a print is running (BUILDING or paused) it re-arms for another period; otherwise it runs a cool-down logged as `{ op: "coolDown", requestedBy: "system", reason: "heater idle timeout" }`; if that cannot be sent it retries every `heaterRetryMs`. Setting both heaters to 0, `coolDown()` and `emergencyStop()` disarm it. The timer lives in the app process: if Morphix exits, the printer keeps whatever target it had.
- **Debounce:** per command, measured from the last accepted request. Not applied to job control (`startPrint`, `pause`, `cancel`, …), `coolDown` or `emergencyStop`.
- **Confirmation without read-back:** `setFan` and `motorsOff` can never be `confirmed` (the QD330 reports neither); they return `acknowledged: true`, `confirmed: false` and a `note`. UIs should show "sent" for these, not "failed". `home` adds a `note` when the head was already at the home position (nothing observable changed).

### Emergency stop: why not M112

`emergencyStop()` is **cancel + heaters off**, not M112:

1. M26 (cancel) is verified on this printer and stops the job. M104/M140 S0 can only remove heat, so they are sent even when `allowUnverified.temperatures` is off.
2. M112 is unverified here. On Marlin-like firmware it halts everything until a power cycle; on FlashForge firmware its effect is unknown (it might do nothing, or leave the printer needing a power cycle while hot). It is therefore only sent, *first*, when the operator sets `allowUnverified.emergencyStopM112` after checklist step M8.
3. Each step is sent even if an earlier one fails, and a dropped link gets one retry on a fresh session. The result lists every step (`data.steps`), `confirmed` means READY with both targets 0.
4. It bumps an interrupt counter: operations queued before it are dropped (`error: "not sent: an emergency stop was requested before …"`), and a confirmation wait in progress (e.g. homing, start) ends at its next poll. An upload already sending packets finishes its packets first (aborting mid-packet would leave the printer in data mode).
5. Never debounced; duplicate taps share one run. **It does not replace the printer's power switch**: if `confirmed` is false the UI must say "use the printer's own screen or power switch".

Call `tracker.noteCancelRequested()` before `emergencyStop()`, as for `cancel()`.

### `capabilities()`

Returns one entry per command (job and machine control) for building buttons, voice tools and portal menus:

```ts
{
  command: "setNozzleTemp", label: "Nozzle temperature", gcode: ["M104"],
  protocolVerified: false, flag: "temperatures", readOnly: false,
  state: "notPrinting", approval: "heater", rateLimited: true,
  enabled: true,        // controller enabled and flag on (read-only commands: always)
  allowedNow: false,    // enabled and the last known state allows it
  reason: "printer is BUILDING_FROM_SD; temperatures are not changed during a print",
}
```

It uses the last status the controller saw (its own reads and every observer poll through `controller.transport`), or a status you pass. With no status yet, state-dependent commands report `"printer status not known yet"`. It is advisory: every method re-reads the printer before sending.

### Fake printer additions

`FakeQD330` now emulates G28 (`homeDurationMs` with MoveMode MOVING, then M114 at 110/110/220, `homeCount`), M146 (`led`, `ledColor`, M119 `LED:`), M106/M107 (`fanPwm`, `fanPercent`), M104/M140 targets with heating/cooling over time (`nozzle`, `bed`, `heatRatePerSec`, `coolRatePerSec`, `setTemp()`), M23 setting print targets (`printTargets`, default 210/50), M26 optionally clearing them (`cancelClearsTargets`, default false), M18 (`motorsEnabled`), M112 (`emergencyHalted`). Extra failures: `ignoreHome`, `ignoreLight`, `ignoreFan`, `ignoreTemps`, `ignoreMotors`, `rejectVerbs: ["M146"]`, `noLedInM119`, `dropAfterM112`. Untouched, it still reports the recorded M105/M114 lines exactly.

## What is verified and what is not

| Fact | Status |
|---|---|
| `~CMD\r\n` framing, `CMD X Received.` … `ok` replies | verified |
| M601 S1 / M602 session | verified |
| M115, M119, M105, M114, M27 formats | verified |
| M661 binary list | verified |
| M28 `<size> 0:/user/<name>` → `Writing to file: /data/<name>` | verified |
| Upload data | **raw bytes, no framing** (as in the open FlashForge Adventurer 4 / legacy-TCP clients). The old 16-byte-header + 4096-padding framing was wrong: the printer stored the header as the start of the file, so jobs opened at 0% and never heated, and the extra bytes swallowed M29 |
| Per-packet replies / error reporting during upload | unknown (controller scans any unsolicited text for error words) |
| M29 reply | expected to end in `ok` once the data is raw; a missing reply now fails the upload |
| M23 → `BUILDING_FROM_SD`, `CurrentFile` | verified (the earlier 0% stalls were the corrupted framed uploads) |
| A real `.gx` printing to completion; M27 values at the end | **unverified** |
| M26 cancel → `READY` | verified |
| M25 pause / M24 resume, and the paused MachineStatus string | **unverified** |
| Whether the printer accepts a second control connection | unknown (controller never opens two) |
| G28 homes X/Y to 110, Z to 220 | verified (when the reply arrives — before or after the move — unknown; 60 s timeout) |
| G1 moves over the network | accepted but ignored (no jog controls offered) |
| M146 light, and M119 `LED:` following it | **unverified** |
| M106/M107 fan; whether M119 `Status: … F:` reflects the fan | **unverified** |
| M104 `S<c> T0` / M140 `S<c>`, and M105 targets following them | **unverified** |
| Whether M26 clears heater targets | **unknown** (emergency stop sends M104/M140 S0 anyway) |
| M18 motors off | **unverified** |
| M112 emergency stop | **unverified** (off unless `emergencyStopM112`) |

---

## Integration steps (apps/desktop — for the coordinator)

1. **Construct once in the main process**, disabled unless the operator turned it on after the checklist:
   ```ts
   const controller = new QD330Controller({
     enabled: settings.printControlsEnabled === true,   // stays false until sign-off
     host: settings.printerHost,
     pausedStatuses: settings.printerPausedStatuses ?? ["PAUSED"],
     log: (e) => logger.info("printer-control", e),     // persist to the logs table
   });
   ```
2. **Route observation through the controller's queue:** replace `new PrinterObserver(new TcpTransport(host), onStatus)` with `new PrinterObserver(controller.transport, onStatus)`. Behaviour is the same (read-only allowlist), but polls can no longer collide with a control session.
3. **Track jobs:** `const tracker = new JobTracker({ pausedStatuses })`; call `tracker.update(status)` in the observer callback; forward tracker events to the renderer over IPC.
4. **On start-up:** after the first poll, `detectActivePrint(observer.status)`. If it returns a print, look up the matching job by file name, `tracker.attachJob(id)`, move the workflow to `printing` (domain `transition` with `printControlsEnabled`), and show "print in progress" instead of the idle screen. Do not start anything.
5. **Approval flow (touch):** the confirm screen shows file, model, estimated time and filament. Only the confirm button handler in the **main process** calls `authorizePrint({ jobId, fileName, approvedBy: "touch", expiresInMs: 60_000 })`. Then `uploadFile` → if `confirmed`, `startPrint` with the same token → if `confirmed`, `tracker.track(...)` and the domain transition to `printing` (`userApproved: true`). Show `error` to the user on any unconfirmed step; never show "printing" unless `startPrint(...).confirmed`.
6. **Approval flow (voice):** Gemini's tool call may only *request* a print. The main process asks the user to confirm ("Say 'yes, print' to start Robot_Arm.gx") and mints the token with `approvedBy: "voice"` only after it hears the confirmation. The model must never be able to call `authorizePrint` directly.
7. **Pause / cancel:** buttons, voice and the Phase 4 guardian call `controller.pause({ requestedBy, reason })` / `controller.cancel(...)`. Call `tracker.noteCancelRequested()` before cancel. Show "pausing…/cancelling…" until the result is `confirmed`; if not confirmed, tell the user to use the printer's own screen.
8. **Resume:** needs a fresh confirmation → new token for the same job and file.
9. **Settings:** keep `printControlsEnabled: false` in shipped config. Turning it on is an operator action after sign-off (below), never something the app or the assistant does.

### Machine controls (touchscreen, voice, portal)

10. **Construct** the controller with `allowUnverified` read from settings (e.g. `settings.printerAllowUnverified`, default all false), and call `controller.dispose()` on app quit (after `coolDown()` if `heaterSafety().armed`).
11. **Touchscreen:** build the machine panel from `controller.capabilities()`; refresh it on each observer status. Hide entries with `enabled: false`; grey out `allowedNow: false` and show `reason`. Suggested buttons: Home, Light on/off (+ colour), Fan 0/50/100 %, Nozzle and Bed presets (e.g. PLA 200/60) with a confirm tap → `approvedBy: "touch"`, Cool down, Motors off, and a red **Emergency stop** reachable from every screen. Show a heater countdown from `heaterSafety()`. Label results: `confirmed` → done; `acknowledged && !confirmed && note` → "sent"; otherwise show `error`. Show an "unverified" badge where `protocolVerified` is false. Catch `RateLimitedError` silently (a repeated tap).
12. **Voice (Gemini tools):** expose `printer_home`, `printer_light(on|color)`, `printer_fan(percent)`, `printer_cool_down`, `printer_motors_off`, `printer_emergency_stop`, `printer_info` and a `printer_set_temperature(heater, celsius)` tool, all with `requestedBy: "voice"`. Heating follows the print-approval pattern: the tool only *requests* it; the main process asks "Heat the nozzle to 200 °C? Say yes to confirm" and calls `setNozzleTemp(200, { requestedBy: "voice", approvedBy: "voice" })` only after hearing yes. The model must never pass `approvedBy` itself. "Stop"/"emergency stop" maps to `emergencyStop` with no confirmation. Speak `error`/`note` back.
13. **Portal (admin):** expose the same commands as admin-only endpoints with `requestedBy: "portal"`; heating needs a confirm dialog in the portal and then `approvedBy: "portal"`. Serve `capabilities()` and `heaterSafety()` read-only to the portal so it can render state; return the `ControlResult` as-is. Never let the portal change `enabled` or `allowUnverified` (they are constructor-only; changing them means an operator edits settings and the app restarts the controller).
14. **Guardian:** keep using `pause`. It may use `emergencyStop({ requestedBy: "guardian" })` only if the operator wants that; it can never heat (no `approvedBy`).
15. **Logs:** every entry has `op`, `requestedBy`, `approvedBy` (heating), `command`, `outcome`. Persist them like the job-control entries.

The domain package already blocks `uploading`/`ready`/`printing` without `printControlsEnabled` and `userApproved`; keep both checks: the domain guard protects the workflow state, the controller guard protects the printer.

## Operator validation checklist

Run on the Pi, at the printer, **with the user present and watching the printer**, one command at a time. For each step write down the exact replies (copy from the control log) in `docs/PHASE5-validation.md`. Stop at the first surprise. Keep a hand near the printer's power switch.

Use a throw-away script or the Node REPL with `new QD330Controller({ enabled: true, host: "192.168.10.51", log: console.log })`. This is the only place `enabled: true` is allowed before sign-off; the app's setting stays off.

**0. Preconditions**
- [ ] Bed clear, filament loaded, nozzle clean; printer shows READY on its own screen.
- [ ] The Afinia software's own print of the same file works (known-good printer).
- [ ] `controller.readStatus()` → `machine: "READY"`, sensible temperatures.

**1. List files (M661)**
- [ ] `listFiles()` returns the files the printer's own screen shows. Note the exact name of an **official Afinia `.gx`** already on the printer (e.g. a calibration cube).

**2. Approval gate dry run (no printer traffic expected)**
- [ ] `startPrint` with no token, an expired token, and a token for a different file all throw `PrintAuthorizationError`; the log shows `rejected`; the printer does nothing.

**3. Start the official `.gx` (M23)**
- [ ] `startPrint({ jobId: "val-1", fileName: "<official>.gx", authorization: authorizePrint({ jobId: "val-1", fileName: "<official>.gx", approvedBy: "touch" }) })`.
- [ ] Result `confirmed: true`; the printer heats and starts printing.
- [ ] Record `MachineStatus`, `CurrentFile` (with or without path/extension?), and M27 during heating and printing.

**4. Let it run, watch tracking**
- [ ] Progress and layer advance in the observer/tracker.
- [ ] Either let it finish and record M119/M27 at the end (sets the completion heuristic), or go on to step 5.

**5. Pause (M25) — unverified command**
- [ ] `pause({ requestedBy: "touch", reason: "validation" })`. The head should park/stop.
- [ ] Record the exact `MachineStatus` while paused. If it is not `PAUSED`, the result is `confirmed: false`: this is expected — add the observed value to `pausedStatuses` and repeat.
- [ ] Check what happens to nozzle/bed temperatures during pause.

**6. Resume (M24) — unverified command**
- [ ] `resume({ jobId: "val-1", fileName, authorization: <fresh token> })` → printing continues where it stopped, `confirmed: true`.

**7. Cancel (M26)**
- [ ] `cancel({ requestedBy: "touch", reason: "validation" })` → printer stops, `confirmed: true` (READY). Record what M27 shows afterwards and whether heaters turn off.
- [ ] Remove the partial print.

**8. Upload a known-good `.gx` (M28/M29)**
- [ ] Take a `.gx` produced by the official Afinia/FlashPrint software for this printer (several packets in size, e.g. > 50 KB).
- [ ] `uploadFile("validation_cube.gx", data, { jobId: "val-2", authorization, onProgress: console.log })` → `confirmed: true`; the file shows on the printer's screen.
- [ ] Note any per-packet replies the printer sent (they appear in errors/logs) and how long M29 took. Adjust `packetDelayMs` if needed.
- [ ] Start it with the same token (`startPrint`) → prints correctly from the first layer (proves the upload was byte-exact). Cancel after a few layers.

**9. Upload a Morphix/Phase 3 `.gx`**
- [ ] Same as step 8 with a file from `packages/slicing`; watch the first layer closely. Cancel at the first sign of trouble.

**10. Failure behaviour**
- [ ] Unplug Ethernet during a print: tracker emits `offline`, print continues, `online` on reconnect, no false `failed`.
- [ ] Restart the app mid-print: start-up shows the print as recovered; nothing is re-sent.
- [ ] Cancel from the printer's own screen: tracker reports `failed` (unexplained stop) — not `completed`.

### Before `enabled` may be turned on in the app

All of the following must be true and written down:

- [ ] Steps 0–10 passed with the user present; replies recorded in `docs/PHASE5-validation.md`.
- [ ] `pausedStatuses` set to the value observed in step 5 (or pause disabled in the UI if M25 did not work).
- [ ] Completion detection checked against a real finished print (step 4); `completeAtProgress` adjusted if needed.
- [ ] Multi-packet upload proven byte-exact (step 8 printed correctly).
- [ ] The app's approval screens (touch and voice) mint tokens only in the main process after an explicit user action, and show "printing" only on `confirmed`.
- [ ] Cancel is reachable from every screen and from voice. Note: operations are queued, so a cancel issued during a start waits for that start's confirmation window (`startConfirmTimeoutMs`, default 20 s); the UI must say "cancelling…" meanwhile and point to the printer's own screen if it does not confirm.
- [ ] The user signs off on Phase 5 in `docs/PHASES.md`.

Until then: `printControlsEnabled: false`, and Morphix only observes.

### Machine controls validation checklist

Same rules as above: on the Pi, at the printer, **user present**, one command at a time, replies recorded in `docs/PHASE5-validation.md`, hand near the power switch. Use a REPL controller with `enabled: true` and **only the one flag under test** in `allowUnverified`, e.g. `new QD330Controller({ enabled: true, host: "192.168.10.51", allowUnverified: { light: true }, log: console.log })`. After each passing step, add that flag to the app's settings; never enable a flag whose step has not passed.

**M0. Info and capabilities (no flags)**
- [ ] `readInfo({ requestedBy: "touch" })` → `confirmed: true`, firmware v2.1.3; record the raw reply.
- [ ] `capabilities()` after `readStatus()`: every unverified command shows `enabled: false`; `home`, `cancel`, `emergencyStop` show `allowedNow: true` at READY.
- [ ] `setLight(true, …)` with no flag throws `CommandDisabledError` naming `allowUnverified.light`; nothing happens at the printer.

**M1. Home (G28, verified — re-check)**
- [ ] Bed clear. `home({ requestedBy: "touch" })` → head homes, `confirmed: true`, position 110/110/220.
- [ ] Record how long the G28 reply took (before or after the move). If after, keep `homeConfirmTimeoutMs` ≥ that.
- [ ] Start a print (or use one in progress), call `home` → `sent: false`, "refused while printing".

**M2. Light (M146) — flag `light`**
- [ ] `setLight(false, …)` → light turns off. Record M119 `LED:` → result `confirmed: true` only if it reads 0.
- [ ] `setLight(true, …)` → white again. `setLight({ r: 255, g: 0, b: 0 }, …)` → does the colour change, or only on/off? Record.
- [ ] If the light changes but `LED:` does not follow: record it; results stay unconfirmed (leave the flag off or accept "sent" in the UI). If nothing happens: leave `light` off.

**M3. Fan (M106/M107) — flag `fan`**
- [ ] `setFan(100, …)` → the part-cooling fan spins up audibly. `setFan(50, …)` → slower. `setFan(false, …)` → stops.
- [ ] Record M119 (`Status: S:… F:…`) before/after: if `F` follows the fan, note it so confirmation can be added later.
- [ ] Check the hotend fan is not affected (it must stay automatic).

**M4. Temperatures (M104/M140) — flag `temperatures`**
- [ ] `setNozzleTemp(150, { requestedBy: "touch", approvedBy: "touch" })` → M105 target `T0:…/150`, `confirmed: true`, the printer's screen shows heating; temperature rises.
- [ ] `setBedTemp(40, { requestedBy: "touch", approvedBy: "touch" })` → bed target 40, `confirmed: true`.
- [ ] `coolDown({ requestedBy: "touch" })` → both targets 0, `confirmed: true`, temperatures fall.
- [ ] Limits: `setNozzleTemp(251, …)` and `setBedTemp(101, …)` throw, and heating without `approvedBy` throws; nothing changes at the printer.
- [ ] Safety timer: with `heaterIdleTimeoutMs: 60_000`, heat the nozzle to 150 and wait 1 min → targets go to 0 by themselves; log shows `coolDown` by `system`.
- [ ] During a print: `setNozzleTemp(…)` and `coolDown()` → `sent: false`. Then `cancel()`; within 2 min `coolDown()` is accepted. Record whether M26 alone already cleared the targets (step 7 of the job checklist).

**M5. Motors off (M18) — flag `motors`**
- [ ] At READY, after homing: `motorsOff({ requestedBy: "touch" })` → the X/Y carriage can be pushed by hand (gently). Result `acknowledged: true`, `confirmed: false` with a note — expected.
- [ ] `home()` afterwards works and re-energises the motors.
- [ ] During a print: `motorsOff` → `sent: false`.

**M6. Emergency stop (no M112)**
- [ ] Start a print (official `.gx`), let it heat and begin. `emergencyStop({ requestedBy: "touch", reason: "validation" })` → printing stops, both targets 0, `confirmed: true`. Record how long until READY.
- [ ] Repeat by voice ("stop") through the app once the app wiring exists.
- [ ] Remove the partial print.

**M7. Debounce**
- [ ] Tap the Light button rapidly 5× in the app: one M146 per second at most in the log; the rest are `rejected` (`RateLimitedError`) or share the running result.

**M8. M112 (optional — only if the owner wants it) — flag `emergencyStopM112`**
- [ ] Only with the user's explicit agreement, at READY with heaters cold first: send `emergencyStop` with `emergencyStopM112: true`. Record exactly what the printer does (halt? needs power cycle? screen message?) and whether M26/M104/M140 still work afterwards.
- [ ] If it requires a power cycle or leaves anything in an unclear state, **leave the flag off**: cancel + cool-down is the emergency stop.

### Before machine flags may be turned on in the app

- [ ] Each flag's step (M2–M5, M8) passed with the user present and replies are recorded.
- [ ] `heaterIdleTimeoutMs` agreed with the owner (default 15 min) and M4's timer check passed.
- [ ] Emergency stop (M6) is reachable from every screen and by voice, and the UI tells the user to use the printer's screen/power switch when it is not `confirmed`.
- [ ] Voice heating goes through a spoken confirmation in the main process; the portal requires a confirm dialog.
