# Vision worker (Phase 4)

A Python/OpenCV process that fetches a snapshot from the QD330 camera at a fixed
interval, runs local checks, and prints **one JSON event per line on stdout**.
`@morphix/guardian` (packages/guardian) spawns it, parses the events and runs
the alert state machine. Gemini is never called from here. The worker never
talks to the printer. It only *receives* printer state on stdin.

What it checks on each frame (analysed at 320 px width; about 4 ms per 1280×720 frame on a laptop. Pi 4 timing hasn't been measured yet, but it should stay far below the 10 s interval):

| Check | How | Event |
|---|---|---|
| Camera reachable | fetch errors, undecodable bytes | `frame_error`, then `camera_lost` after 3 in a row |
| Black / blank frame | mean brightness < 12 or std < 4 | same as above, reason `black_frame` / `blank_frame` |
| Frozen stream | byte-identical or pixel-identical frames | `frozen_frame` after 6 repeats |
| Spaghetti | sudden rise of Canny edges **and** thin-strand (top-hat) texture in the bed ROI vs a slow baseline | `possible_failure` → `confirmed_failure` (`kind: "spaghetti"`) |
| Detachment / big change | > 30 % of ROI pixels differ from the background model, while the area outside the ROI does not (so a lighting change doesn't count) | kind `detachment` |
| Stalled | printer reports printing but < 0.3 % of ROI pixels changed for `--stall-seconds` (default 600) | kind `stalled` |

A failure is **confirmed** only when it is seen in N of the last M frames
(`--confirm 3/5`). Repeated identical frames don't count towards N.
Baselines learn only from frames that look normal, so a failure can't become
the new normal. While the printer state is known and not printing (READY,
PAUSED, …), failure checks are off. With no printer state at all they run,
but `stalled` stays off.

Evidence: each suspicious frame is saved as
`<evidence-dir>/<UTC stamp>_<n>_suspect_<kinds>.jpg`, plus one
`..._confirmed_<kind>.jpg` when a failure is confirmed (at most `--max-evidence`
files per run).

## Install on the Pi (Debian 13, arm64)

The simplest option uses the distro packages, with no compiler and no wheels:

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3-opencv python3-numpy
```

Or use a venv. `opencv-python-headless` publishes aarch64 wheels:

```bash
cd ~/morphix/services/vision
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you use the venv, point the app at it with `MORPHIX_PYTHON=/home/jd/morphix/services/vision/.venv/bin/python`.

## Run by hand

```bash
cd services/vision
python3 -m morphix_vision \
  --snapshot-url 'http://192.168.10.51:8080/?action=snapshot' \
  --interval 10 \
  --evidence-dir ~/Morphix/snapshots/manual-test \
  --roi 0.15,0.2,0.7,0.75
```

Paste printer state on stdin to enable the stalled check:

```
{"type":"printer_state","machine":"BUILDING_FROM_SD","progress":12}
```

Other stdin messages: `{"type":"reset_baseline"}` and `{"type":"shutdown"}`.

Tune the bed region with `--roi x,y,w,h`, given as fractions of the frame. Check
it against a saved snapshot: the ROI should cover the build plate and whatever
is printed on it, and leave out the rails and the top of the chamber.

Replay recorded snapshots without the camera:

```bash
python3 -m morphix_vision --replay-dir ~/Morphix/snapshots/some-session --no-stdin
```

Run `python3 -m morphix_vision --help` for all thresholds.

## Tests

```bash
cd services/vision
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

The tests generate synthetic chamber images: a blue bed, a part, a moving head,
sensor noise, spaghetti strands, a dragged part, and black, blank or frozen
frames. They need no network and no camera. For the TypeScript end-to-end test
against this worker, run
`MORPHIX_TEST_PYTHON=$PWD/services/vision/.venv/bin/python ./node_modules/.bin/vitest run tests/phase4-guardian.test.ts`
from the repo root.

The full event format is in [docs/PHASE4.md](../../docs/PHASE4.md).
